for larger numbers, negative values, and target pixel offsets.  To see the effects, click on one of the verbs in the verb \
panel, or bump into one of the dummy mobs.

<b><font color="blue">Verb descriptions:</font></b>

Little Hit - This verb causes a red, floating, negative number to appear above you.
Big Hit - This causes a large, yellow, negative number to appear.  Above certain values, the number appears in scientific \
notation.
Little Heal - This creates a small, green, positive number.
Big Heal - And now, a large, aqua, positive number.  Again, really large numbers appear in scientific notation.

Notice that when bumping into the dummy mobs, the floating numbers pixel offset match the dummy, always centering \
themselves above them.

Have fun,

Flick
